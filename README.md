## Introduction

In this episode, we are going to build a Blazor Server App using Visual Studio 2022 Preview. We are going to add SQLite by adding a NuGet package reference to `add-package`.

At the end, you should end-up with a sample app that stores data locally.

End results will look like this:

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are needed for this demo.

### .NET 6.0

Download the latest version of the .NET 6.0 SDK [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

>:blue_book: The demo below also applies to `ASP.NET Core` versions 3.0, 3.1, and 5.0, but we are using 6.0 for this demo.

### Visual Studio 2022 Preview

For this demo, we are going to use the latest version of [Visual Studio 2022 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).

### Mobile Development with .NET Workload

In order to build Blazor apps, the ASP.NET and web development workload needs to be installed, so if you do not have that installed let's do that now.
